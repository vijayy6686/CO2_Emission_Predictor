📘 Project Description: CO₂ Emission Predictor
🔹 Project Overview

The CO₂ Emission Predictor is an end-to-end machine learning web application designed to estimate vehicle carbon dioxide emissions (g/km) based on vehicle specifications and fuel consumption data.
The project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to environmental impact analysis by building a complete pipeline—from data preprocessing and model training to deployment through an interactive web interface.

Users can enter vehicle details such as engine size, transmission type, fuel type, and fuel consumption values to obtain an instant CO₂ emission prediction. The application focuses on accuracy, transparency, and clean ML engineering practices, avoiding misleading or artificial metrics.

🔹 Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project consists of real-world vehicle specifications and emission measurements. It includes a mix of categorical and numerical features, making it suitable for a supervised regression problem.

Key features include:

Vehicle manufacturer (Make)

Vehicle class (e.g., compact, SUV, pickup)

Engine size (liters)

Number of cylinders

Transmission type

Fuel type

Fuel consumption (city, highway, combined)

CO₂ emissions

Target Variable:

CO₂ Emissions (grams per kilometer)

The dataset reflects realistic automotive emission data and is commonly used for fuel efficiency and environmental analysis.

🔹 Methodology

The project follows a supervised machine learning regression approach:

Data Preprocessing

Categorical features are encoded within a preprocessing pipeline

Numerical features are scaled for consistency

Feature engineering includes converting combined fuel consumption from L/100 km to MPG

Model Training

A regression model is trained using scikit-learn

Preprocessing and model steps are encapsulated in a single Pipeline

This ensures identical transformations during training and prediction

Model Persistence

The trained pipeline is saved using joblib

The serialized model is reused directly during deployment without retraining

This pipeline-based methodology improves reproducibility, reliability, and maintainability.

🔹 Implementation

The application is implemented using Streamlit, providing a clean and interactive user interface.

Implementation highlights:

Structured input forms for vehicle and fuel data

Persistent user inputs using Streamlit session state (prevents reset on reruns)

Real-time CO₂ emission prediction on button click

Minimal dark-themed UI using embedded HTML and CSS

Direct integration with the trained ML pipeline for inference

The backend strictly returns predictions in g/km, maintaining scientific accuracy without adding fabricated environmental indicators.
